# Hooks Best Practices

1. Use Hooks at the Top Level: Always call Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. This ensures that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.
2. Only Call Hooks from React Functions: Hooks should only be called from React function components or custom Hooks, not from regular JavaScript functions.
3. Keep Hooks Pure: Hooks should not cause side effects. Use useEffect for side effects like data fetching or subscriptions.
4. Optimize Performance: Use useMemo and useCallback to memoize expensive calculations and functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
5. Encapsulate Logic in Custom Hooks: If you find yourself using the same logic in multiple components, consider creating a custom Hook to encapsulate that logic.
6. Use Dependency Arrays in useEffect: Always specify dependencies in useEffect to avoid unnecessary re-runs of the effect.
7. Avoid Overusing State: Use state sparingly and only when necessary. Too many state variables can make your component complex and hard to manage.
